<h2 align="left">Hi 👋🏻,  I'm Ha-Yeong 👩🏻‍💻</h1>

🎯  I am an AI research engineer with a background in computer science and artificial intelligence, currently focusing on speech synthesis. <br> <br>
🤗  I have a keen interest in `speech synthesis`, `generative models`, and `multi-modal systems`. <br> <br>
🧭 My ultimate research goal is to develop technology that benefits human life, and to break down barriers for the disadvantaged through AI, creating a more convenient world. Recently, I have been interested in and researching zero-shot TTS, controllable speech generation, and fast speech decoding for multimodal agents. However, my research interests are not limited to this area.
